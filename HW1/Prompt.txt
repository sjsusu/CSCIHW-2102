Implement a superclass Appointment and subclasses
Onetime, Daily, and Monthly. An appointment
has a description (for example, “see the dentist”)
and a date. Write a method occursOn(int year,
int month, int day) that checks whether the
appointment occurs on that date. For example, for
a monthly appointment, you must check whether
the day of the month matches. Then fill an array of
Appointment objects with a mixture of appointments.
Have the user enter a date and print out all appointments that occur on that date.
