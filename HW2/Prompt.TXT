PROJECT TITLE: HW2

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: 
        
      /* Modify the implementation of the Data class in Section 10.1 to use both a
       * Measurer and a Filter object. Only objects that the filter accepts should 
       * be processed. Demonstrate your modification by processing a collection of 
       * bank accounts, filtering out all accounts with balances less than $1,000.
